# About gpt-backend

gpt-backend serves as the back-end for the Islamic Information website. It is a reliable online resource that offers accurate information about Islam, providing a wide range of articles and resources on various topics related to the faith. It serves as an excellent source of information for both Muslims and non-Muslims.

# Backend Implementation Details

The backend implementation includes the following:

- Setting up a MongoDB database to store the application's data.
- Creating an Express application to handle routing and API endpoints.
- Implementing a GraphQL server to handle client requests.
- Utilizing Node.js as the server runtime to run the Express application.
- Creating routes to handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for the data. These routes interact with the MongoDB database using an ODM library like Mongoose.
- Defining GraphQL schemas to handle query and mutation requests for the data.
- Implementing controller functions that handle the logic for each API endpoint, interacting with the database and returning responses.
